1. Top Bar

A 'greedy' navigation was created for the secondary navigation to ensure that all important links were maintained on all devices.

2. Header 

For mobile a slideout navigation is utilised to save space and maintain a clean mobile interface, whilst ensuring all importants call to action are in place. For desktop the header matches the designs, with a clean layout.

3. Hero Banner

For mobile, a simple overlay to hold the title text over the main image is utilised, whilst the bullet list comes in for tablet size and up. For desktop, a simple two column layout inside a container, absolutely placed over the background image. For extra large screens, jQuery is utilised to size the background image to ensure that no overlapping of text occurs.

A quick slick slider is utilised in the services list to ensure all data is displayed in a user friendly way and prevent excessive scrolling. Simple hover animations are utilised to add a pop to the site.
